# CompanyName + Plaid // Solutions Guide

## What You're Building

HOA financial management platform that needs to:
- Connect bank accounts for business customers (HOAs)
- Import transaction data for accounting/reconciliation
- Integrate with Stripe for payments
- Keep sensitive data storage minimal for compliance

## Core Plaid Integration

### 1. Bank Account Connection (`Link` + `Auth`)
**What it does**: Secure bank account linking with account/routing number retrieval

**Customization**: Logo, colors, copy via dashboard templates

**Documentation**: [Link Overview](https://plaid.com/docs/link/) | [Auth API](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/)

### 2. Stripe Integration (`Auth`)
**One extra API call** after account connection

### 3. Transaction Data (`Transactions`)
**Real-time transaction sync** for accounting features

**Documentation**: [Transactions API](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/)

## Integration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as HOA User
    participant App as Your App
    participant Plaid as Plaid Link
    participant Bank as User's Bank
    participant Stripe as Stripe

    User->>App: Click "Connect Bank Account"
    App->>Plaid: Initialize Link Token
    Plaid-->>App: Link Token
    App->>User: Show Plaid Link UI
    User->>Plaid: Enter bank credentials
    Plaid->>Bank: Authenticate user
    Bank-->>Plaid: Auth success
    Plaid-->>App: public_token
    App->>Plaid: Exchange for access_token
    Plaid-->>App: access_token & account info
    App->>Plaid: Get Auth data (account/routing)
    Plaid-->>App: Account details
    App->>Stripe: Create processor token
    Stripe-->>App: Processor token
    App->>Plaid: Start transaction sync
    Plaid-->>App: Transaction data
```

## Key Technical Details

### Access Token Management
- **Tokens don't expire** (unless user changes bank password)
- Store encrypted in your backend only
- Get webhooks when tokens need updates
- Users can revoke via `/item/remove` endpoint

### Implementation Flow
1. HOA user clicks "Connect Bank Account"
2. Plaid Link opens (with your branding)
3. User authenticates with their bank
4. You get access_token
5. Generate Stripe processor token
6. Start syncing transaction data

## What You Get Out of the Box
‚úÖ **Security**: SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR compliant
‚úÖ **Bank Coverage**: 12,000+ US institutions
‚úÖ **Webhooks**: Real-time account status updates
‚úÖ **User Control**: Built-in consent and revocation
